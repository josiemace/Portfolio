Following is the work I completed while employeed with Digby's Detective & Security Agency (May 2022 - December 2022).

The premise of these projects being a third party robot that detects people and license plates, that then sends alerts to Digby's 
once such a detection occurs. 

A CSV can then be pulled from the robot detailing each alert that has occured over a given period of time & takes the following form:

| ID	| Date	| Time	| MIN	| Latitude	| Longitude	| Event Type	| Sector Name	| Threat Level	| Clear |	Clear Date	| Clear Time	| Sign-off Name	| Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 12345	| 05/08/2023	| 22:32:08 | 72	| 39.78712615	| -82.93416547  | Person(s) detected	| City, OH	| Red	| TRUE	| ('05/08/2023',)	| ('22:35:55',)	| employee@digbysecurity.com	| Cleared by 9133 |

etc....

I was assigned 3 tasks given this information, leading to three independent project designs & implementations:

  1). [Monthly Reports](Monthly_Reports.ipynb)
  
      Consolidating & manipulating the given data each month as a method of progress monitoring and control.
      This included determining average response times and splitting the alerts by the period of time in which
      it took to respond to it (i.e., within 5 minutes, within 10 minutes, etc.). 
      
  2). Employee Reports
  
      This project centered around retrieving repsonse data from each individual employee to evaluate 
      performance. It required both aggregating all individual data, as well as cross refrencing other
      data sets containing information about the hours each individual was activley working.
      
  3). Alert Density Report
  
      In order to maximize company cost-benefits for each client, robots and officers needed to be deployed 
      during the hours where the most activity was seen. As such, I was asked to create a way of quanitifying 
      alert data/history by hour leading to the alert density report.
