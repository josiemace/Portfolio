# Portfolio

My name is Josie Mace and I am a software developer who specializes in machine learning. I studied at the Illinois Institute of Technology
where I recieved a Bachelors of Science in Artificial Intelligence. While attending IIT I had the opportunity to work in collaboration with IBM Watson on a telescope commissioning, where I developed a Swift fitz image viewer as well as a pathfinder to prevent the telescope from colliding with itself. Soon after I landed an internship position with Digby's Security Agency in Chicago where I worked as a software developer and data analyst. I now reside in Boston, MA where I am searching for a mutually beneficial position as a software devloper.
The links below contain examples on some of these programs I developed in my experience. Thank you for your time!
